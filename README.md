The CharacterProfilingTool lets you define profiles for your story or movie characters. The tool makes use of IndexedDB, and therefore data is stored in your browser not on a web server.

You can add, delete and edit your characters any time.

The tool itself is made with Bootstrap, and very simple.

Click on the "Add" button to add a new character, and a form will open with some text input fields. The only required field is the "Name" field. The other fields are all optional.

It should be self explanatory but feel free to comment.

This tool is not a tool to create and manage a whole project. It's just a character editing tool.
