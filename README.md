# README
This project is a proof of concept (POC), and should proof that IndexedDB is a viable storage solution for such a project. But it is not.

This simple character profiling tool lets you define profiles for your story or movie characters. The tool makes use of IndexedDB, and therefore data is stored in your browser not on a web server.

You can add, delete and edit your characters any time.

The tool itself is made with Bootstrap, and very simple.

Click on the "Add" button to add a new character, and a form will open with some text input fields. The only required field is the "Name" field. The other fields are all optional.

It should be self explanatory but feel free to comment.

This tool is not a tool to create and manage a whole project. It's just a character editing tool.

## Installation and Usage
No installation required. To use this tool simply download the files, and open the index.html file in your browser, and start adding characters.
